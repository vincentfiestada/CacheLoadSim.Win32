CacheLoadSim.Win32
==================

A version of the Cache Load Simulator project in standard C++, built and tested for Win32

See the original project, which is for Windows 8.1 and must be built from source using Visual Studio 2013.
https://github.com/vincentfiestada/CacheLoadSim

Supports FIFO, LRU, and LFU replacement algorithms Supports Direct, Set Associative and Fully Associative Mapping algorithm

I recommend you use Visual Studio C++ compiler to build this project.
I haven't tested it on other CPP compilers
